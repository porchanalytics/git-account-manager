# Git Account Manager

**Effortlessly manage multiple GitHub accounts with automated identity switching, SSH configuration, and intelligent workflow assistance.**

## The Problem

Modern developers often juggle multiple GitHub identities‚Äîpersonal projects, client work, employer repositories, and open source contributions. Each context requires different git identities (name/email), SSH keys, and access permissions. Manual management leads to:

- **Identity Mix-ups**: Committing personal work with your business email (or vice versa)
- **SSH Key Confusion**: Wrong keys causing authentication failures  
- **Manual Overhead**: Constantly switching `git config` settings and remote URLs
- **Compliance Risks**: Accidentally exposing business code in personal repositories

This project arose from the daily frustration of managing multiple GitHub accounts for a data analytics consultancy. What started as a simple script to switch git identities evolved into a comprehensive automation toolkit that eliminates the mental overhead of context switching.

## The Solution

Git Account Manager provides intelligent automation that:

‚úÖ **Prevents Identity Mix-ups**: Automatic detection and correction of git identity mismatches  
‚úÖ **Simplifies SSH Management**: One-command SSH host alias setup with proper key isolation  
‚úÖ **Streamlines Workflows**: Clone, create, and configure repositories with single commands  
‚úÖ **Enforces Compliance**: Pre-push hooks prevent commits with incorrect identities  
‚úÖ **Provides Visibility**: Comprehensive help system and audit logging

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/dckallos/git-account-manager.git ~/.config/git-account-manager
cd ~/.config/git-account-manager
source bin/git-account-manager.sh

# Add to your shell (one-time setup)
echo 'source ~/.config/git-account-manager/bin/git-account-manager.sh' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Configuration

Create your private configuration file:

```bash
# Create config (never committed to git)
cp lib/gam-config.example.sh ~/.config/git-account-manager/config.sh
$EDITOR ~/.config/git-account-manager/config.sh
```

Fill in your account details:

```bash
# Personal account

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fork and Customize Open Source Libraries

**Context**: You discover a useful open source library but need to customize it for company use while maintaining proper attribution and identity separation.

```bash
# Traditional approach (15+ manual steps, error-prone)
git clone https://github.com/facebook/react.git
cd react
git config user.name "Company Developer"
git config user.email "dev@company.com"
git remote set-url origin git@github-company:company/react-fork.git
gh repo create company/react-fork --private
git push -u origin main
# ... hope you didn't forget anything ...

# Git Account Manager approach (1 interactive command)
git-clone-and-own
# Interactive prompts guide you through:
# Source: facebook/react
# New name: porchanalytics-react-customized  
# Account: business
# Visibility: private
# 
# Result: Perfect setup in 30 seconds with zero configuration errors
```

**What happened automatically:**
- ‚úÖ Repository cloned with correct SSH configuration
- ‚úÖ Business identity configured for all commits
- ‚úÖ Remote pointed to porchanalytics GitHub with proper SSH host alias
- ‚úÖ New repository created on GitHub with specified visibility
- ‚úÖ Audit log entry created for compliance tracking

### Scenario 2: Contributing to Multiple Open Source Projects

**Context**: You're contributing to several open source projects and need consistent personal identity across all contributions.

```bash
# Traditional workflow headaches
cd ~/projects/kubernetes
git config user.email personal@email.com  # Remember to set this every time
git config user.name "Your Name"         # Hope it matches other contributions

cd ~/projects/docker  
git config user.email personal@email.com  # Oops, forgot again
# Submit PR with wrong business email... embarrassing!

# Git Account Manager workflow  
git-clone-personal kubernetes/kubernetes ~/projects/k8s-contrib
git-clone-personal docker/docker ~/projects/docker-contrib
git-clone-personal microsoft/vscode ~/projects/vscode-contrib

# Each repository automatically configured with:
# ‚úÖ Personal identity (consistent name/email)
# ‚úÖ Personal SSH key for authentication
# ‚úÖ Proper remote configuration
# ‚úÖ No manual git config required ever
```

**Quick identity verification across projects:**
```bash
# Check identity in any repository instantly
cd ~/projects/k8s-contrib && git-whoami
# üü¢ Personal Account: Daniel Kallos <d.kalleward@gmail.com>

cd ~/projects/docker-contrib && git-whoami  
# üü¢ Personal Account: Daniel Kallos <d.kalleward@gmail.com>
# Consistent across all personal projects!
```

### Scenario 3: Complex Multi-Client Consulting Workflow

**Context**: Data consultant working on projects for different clients, each requiring separate business identities and repository access.

```bash
# Managing multiple client codebases traditionally
# Client A project
cd ~/work/client-a
git config user.name "Consultant Name"
git config user.email "consultant@client-a.com"
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:client-a/project.git

# Client B project  
cd ~/work/client-b
git config user.name "Consultant Name"  
git config user.email "consultant@client-b.com"
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:client-b/analytics.git
# Repeat for every repository... exhausting!

# Git Account Manager approach with profile switching
# Setup custom client profiles in config.sh:
GAM_CLIENTA_NAME="Daniel Kallos"
GAM_CLIENTA_EMAIL="daniel@client-a.com"
GAM_CLIENTA_GITHUB="client-a-org"
GAM_CLIENTA_SSH_KEY="~/.ssh/id_ed25519_client_a"

GAM_CLIENTB_NAME="Daniel Kallos"  
GAM_CLIENTB_EMAIL="daniel@client-b.com"
GAM_CLIENTB_GITHUB="client-b-org"
GAM_CLIENTB_SSH_KEY="~/.ssh/id_ed25519_client_b"

# Clone with automatic client-specific configuration
git-clone --account clienta --owner client-a-org --repo analytics-dashboard
git-clone --account clientb --owner client-b-org --repo data-pipeline

# Switch contexts instantly as you move between projects
cd ~/work/client-a-dashboard
use-clienta  # Instantly switches to Client A identity

cd ~/work/client-b-pipeline  
use-clientb  # Instantly switches to Client B identity
```

### Scenario 4: Emergency Identity Fix During Live Demo

**Context**: You're presenting your work to stakeholders and realize you've been committing with the wrong identity.

```bash
# The nightmare scenario (traditional git)
git log --oneline
# 5f3a2b1 Add customer dashboard    # Wrong! Should be business email
# 8e1c4d7 Fix authentication bug    # Personal email in business repo
# a9b6e2f Initial implementation    # Identity chaos...

# Manual fix attempt during presentation
git config user.email business@company.com
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # Interactive rebase to fix commits
# ... 10 minutes of git surgery while stakeholders wait ...

# Git Account Manager auto-fix
git push origin main
# System detects identity mismatch:
# üîß Auto-fixing identity mismatch: switching to business account
# ‚úÖ Identity corrected for future commits
# üìù Audit log updated: emergency identity switch

# Alternative: Proactive fix
git-doctor
# üîç Analyzing repository health...
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Identity mismatch detected (personal email in business repo)
# üîß Auto-fixing: switching to business account
# ‚úÖ Repository configuration corrected
# üí° Tip: Use git-install-guard-hook to prevent future mix-ups
```

### Scenario 5: Rapid Prototype to Production Pipeline

**Context**: Moving a personal side project into production as a business offering.

```bash
# Traditional migration (manual, error-prone)
cd ~/personal/awesome-analytics-tool
git remote -v  # Check current remote
git remote set-url origin git@github-business:company/analytics-platform.git
git config user.name "Business Name" 
git config user.email "dev@company.com"
gh repo create company/analytics-platform --private
git push origin main
# Cross fingers that everything is configured correctly...

# Git Account Manager migration (foolproof)
cd ~/personal/awesome-analytics-tool

# Method 1: In-place migration
use-business  # Switch current repo to business identity
git-remote-set --account business --owner porchanalytics --repo analytics-platform
# ‚úÖ Repository migrated with proper business configuration

# Method 2: Create clean business copy
git-clone-and-own --src dckallos/awesome-analytics-tool
# Interactive prompts:
# New repository name: analytics-platform
# Target account: business  
# Visibility: private
# ‚úÖ Clean business repository created with complete history
```

### Scenario 6: Collaborative Team Development

**Context**: Working on both internal company projects and external collaborations with partners.

```bash
# Managing mixed internal/external work traditionally
# Internal company project
cd ~/work/internal-api
git config user.email internal@company.com
ssh-add ~/.ssh/company_internal_key

# External collaboration  
cd ~/work/partner-integration
git config user.email external@company.com
ssh-add ~/.ssh/company_external_key
# Managing multiple SSH keys and identities manually...

# Git Account Manager team workflow
# Clone internal company projects
git-clone-business porchanalytics/internal-api
git-clone-business porchanalytics/customer-portal  
git-clone-business porchanalytics/data-pipeline

# Clone external collaboration projects
git-clone --account partner --owner partner-company --repo joint-integration
git-clone --account partner --owner standards-org --repo api-specification

# Seamless context switching
cd ~/work/internal-api
git-whoami
# üîµ Business Account: Daniel Kallos <fake-email@porchanalytics.com>

cd ~/work/joint-integration  
git-whoami
# üü° Partner Account: Daniel Kallos <daniel@external-partner.com>

# Team members can standardize their workflow
git-help workflows  # Share standardized approaches across team
```

### Scenario 7: Teaching and Content Creation

**Context**: Developer creating educational content while maintaining separation between teaching materials and professional work.

```bash
# Managing educational vs professional content
# Create course examples with personal identity
git-clone-personal dckallos/docker-tutorial ./courses/docker-basics
git-clone-personal dckallos/react-examples ./courses/react-fundamentals

# Professional consulting materials with business identity  
git-clone-business porchanalytics/client-workshops ./professional/workshops
git-clone-business porchanalytics/proposal-templates ./professional/templates

# Content creation workflow
cd ~/courses/docker-basics
git-whoami
# üü¢ Personal Account: Daniel Kallos <d.kalleward@gmail.com>
# Perfect for public tutorials and open source examples

cd ~/professional/workshops
git-whoami  
# üîµ Business Account: Daniel Kallos <fake-email@porchanalytics.com>
# Proper business attribution for professional materials

# Rapid content deployment
git-clone-and-own --src dckallos/tutorial-template
# Transform personal template into client-specific material:
# New name: client-training-materials
# Account: business
# Visibility: private
# ‚úÖ Ready for client delivery with proper business branding
```

### Scenario 8: Compliance and Audit Trail

**Context**: Organization requiring detailed audit trails for code repository access and identity management.

```bash
# Traditional audit challenges
# Manual tracking of who committed what with which identity
# No systematic way to ensure identity compliance
# Difficult to audit cross-repository identity consistency

# Git Account Manager compliance features
# Comprehensive audit logging
tail ~/.local/state/git-account-manager/audit.log
# 2025-09-03T10:15:23Z use-business repo=/work/client-project email=dev@company.com
# 2025-09-03T10:22:41Z clone-business owner=company repo=analytics-dashboard
# 2025-09-03T11:05:17Z identity-fix repo=/work/mixed-project from=personal to=business
# 2025-09-03T11:30:55Z use-personal repo=/personal/side-project email=dev@personal.com

# Proactive compliance enforcement  
git-install-guard-hook --global
# Install pre-push hooks across all repositories

# Result: Automatic identity validation on every push
git push origin feature-branch
# üîç Validating identity against remote...
# ‚úÖ Business identity matches business repository
# üöÄ Push proceeding...

# OR if identity mismatch:
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Identity mismatch detected!
# üõë Push blocked: personal identity in business repository
# üí° Run 'use-business' to fix identity and retry

# Systematic compliance verification
git-doctor --audit
# üìä Repository Compliance Report
# ‚úÖ 15 repositories with correct identity configuration
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  2 repositories with mixed commit identities  
# üîß 3 repositories auto-fixed during scan

## Productivity Benefits

### Time Savings Analysis

```bash
# Traditional manual workflow time costs:
# ‚Ä¢ Initial SSH key setup per repository: ~5 minutes
# ‚Ä¢ Identity configuration per project: ~2 minutes  
# ‚Ä¢ Troubleshooting SSH issues: ~15 minutes
# ‚Ä¢ Recovering from identity mix-ups: ~20 minutes
# ‚Ä¢ Manual remote URL configuration: ~3 minutes

# Git Account Manager time costs:
# ‚Ä¢ One-time setup: 10 minutes
# ‚Ä¢ Per-repository setup: 30 seconds (automated)
# ‚Ä¢ Identity switching: 5 seconds
# ‚Ä¢ Issue resolution: Usually automatic

# Example: Managing 20 repositories traditionally
# Setup: 20 √ó (5 + 2 + 3) = 200 minutes (3.3 hours)
# Maintenance: Monthly issues √ó 15-20 minutes each
# 
# With Git Account Manager:
# Setup: 10 minutes one-time + 20 √ó 0.5 minutes = 20 minutes
# Maintenance: Largely automated
#
# üìä Result: ~90% time savings on git identity management
```

### Developer Experience Improvements

```bash
# Before: Mental overhead and context switching
cd personal-project/        # Remember to check identity
git config user.email       # Verify current settings  
# ... start coding ...
git commit -m "feature"     # Hope identity is correct
git push                    # Cross fingers for SSH access

# After: Zero cognitive load
cd personal-project/        
# Identity automatically correct
git commit -m "feature"     # Confidence in correct attribution
git push                    # SSH always works
```

#   ‚úÖ GitHub CLI authenticated for both accounts  
#   ‚úÖ Git global configuration properly isolated
#   ‚úÖ Shell integration working correctly
#   ‚úÖ Audit logging functional
# 
# Performance Metrics:
#   ‚ö° Identity switching: 0.12 seconds average
#   ‚ö° Repository cloning: 2.3 seconds average overhead
#   üìä System resource usage: Minimal impact
```

## Why This Approach Works

### Before Git Account Manager
- **Manual Context Switching**: Remember to change git config for each project
- **Error-Prone Setup**: Easy to use wrong SSH keys or remote URLs
- **Identity Mix-ups**: Frequent commits with incorrect email addresses
- **Compliance Risk**: Accidental exposure of business code in personal accounts

### After Git Account Manager  
- **Automatic Intelligence**: System detects and corrects configuration issues
- **One-Command Operations**: Complex workflows reduced to single commands
- **Zero Mental Overhead**: No need to remember account-specific configurations  
- **Compliance Built-In**: Pre-push hooks and audit logging ensure proper separation

The result is a development experience where account management becomes invisible, letting you focus on code instead of configuration.
